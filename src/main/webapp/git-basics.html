			<h1>Natural Evolution</h1>
			<h2>RCS</h2>
			<div class="notes">
				<p>Who remembers RCS? I'm going to bet it's a small number of
					people.</p>

				<p>RCS was a simple version control system that would keep a
					timestamp and a version for each file. The expectation was that you
					were dealing with small builds and there wasn't much to do other
					than keep track of your handful of files. Once projects got big
					enough to have many files, it became very difficult to check in
					files one at a time using RCS. So, a wrapper to this was created to
					handle checking in files en masse.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id="naturalEvolution2" class="step">
			<h1>Natural Evolution</h1>
			<h2>CVS</h2>
			<div class="notes">
				<p>CVS, the wrapper for RCS, works well enough. We eventually
					found that, much like FTP, there is a lack of security and it can't
					keep track of file rollbacks/deletions very well. For example, if
					you have a file "folder1/abc.java" and you delete it, there is very
					little to be able to determine what was there before it was
					deleted, as the server stores this in an "abc.java" delta file,
					which it then deletes. Also, if you moved "abc.java" from "folder1"
					to "folder2", it essentially deletes one file and creates it in
					another place, essentially destroying any history.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div id="naturalEvolution3" class="step">
			<h1>Natural Evolution</h1>
			<h2>Subversion, CVSNT</h2>
			<div class="notes">
				<p>Enter SubVersion. Everyone here should be familiar with
					SubVersion. First thing, security was increased. SSL and SSH were
					built in natively, allowing for extremely secure connections. Also,
					where CVS keeps losing track of files and versioning because it
					keeps the versioning within each file on the server, subversion
					applies a version to the entire repository. If you check in
					"abc.java", the entire repository updates the version to "2.3.758"
					(or something like that) and can immediately tell you when you are
					out of sync. This way, even if you move a file (though it has do be
					done correctly, via the refactor/move commands), it will retain the
					entire history of a moved or deleted file. Also, you never have to
					worry about "abc.java" is on v2.3 but "def.java" is on v2.4 -
					because the versions are cross-cutting.</p>

				<p>This worked great and still works great. Subversion is
					releasing still and people use it all the time. But it still has
					some problems in our mobile development world. First, What if you
					are on a long flight or in an institution where internet is
					unaccessable and you need to work on files - at the end, you might
					have to deal with a painful merge. Or, you may not have access to
					history, due to lack of connection to the server. Also, server
					replication between sites became painful, although still usable.</p>

			<h1>Natural Evolution</h1>
			<h2>DCVS (Git, Mercurial, etc.)</h2>
			<div class="notes">
				<h3>So why use Distributed Concurrent Versions Systems?</h3>
				<p>First, it's got a small footprint. Using SHA-1 (a
					cryptographic hash function), git compares files and only keeps
					differences. So, just because you made a tag, it doesn't mean that
					everything needs to be copied. It's just a pointer to a position.
					Developers should appreciate that and think of this much like a
					Linked-List pointer. A simple file structure in Git or Mercurial
					will be easily half the size of a Subversion repository. And that's
					if you don't count branches or tags.</p>
				<h3>Your repository is local.</h3>
				<p>What does this mean to you? It means that start using a
					repository, I don't have to contact IT. When I have no internet and
					I need to look through the history of a file, I can do that. When I
					need to make frequent checkins or rollbacks, I can do that. Also,
					if I want to synchronize with someone else, and we have no
					repository, we can do that. Need to check out a tag? You don't need
					access to the server for that. Also, that means that if there is
					catastrophic failure, I can work with others directly to get all
					the latest code.</p>
				<p>
				<h3>It's Fast</h3>
				<p>Because of the fact that DCVS is keeping very tiny changes
					and keeping them indexed well, it is really fast. If you check
					statistics, you'll find that these tend to be an order of magnitude
					faster for all tasks, including initialization, commits, branching,
					and even running diffs.</p>
				<p>
				<h3>It's Here</h3>
				<p>Not only has Git become the goto for C/C++/Java developers,
					but is in use for a bunch of other languages as well. It has become
					the default SCM in the new version of Eclipse/STS. It is available
					in the world wide web via GitHub, Gitoreus and other similar
					websites, and it even has tools that plug directly into your
					operating system so you can version files of any type. It's also
					available locally. Plus, whether the company wants you to use it or
					not (luckily ours has been more than accomidating), you can use Git
					locally. You don't even need a server anymore for version control.
					Also, using the git-svn bridge, you can use Git with Subversion.
					This gives you many of the advantages of Git in your current
					environment.</p>

			<h2>Different Environments - Same Machine</h2>
			<div class="horizontal-center">
				<img alt="Local Repository" src="images/git-local.png">
			</div>
			<div class="notes">
				<p>
					There are three environments <i>on your local computer</i>. I want
					to make this very clear, as you don't really need to worry about
					external repositories quite yet. The repository and staging area
					aren't directly accessable to you. You need to use the git commands
					to make any changes to those environments. If you want to make a
					change in your working directory, this is essentially the files
					that are accessible to you on your file system. Go about your
					business and edit your files.
				</p>
				<p>In this example, I'm going to adjust the files from the clone
					that we did in the last slide. Create a file "MessyRoom.txt" in the
					poems folder. If you make a change to a file, it is done in your
					working directory.</p>

				<p>Add a file called "TimeFlies.txt" with the following content:</p>

				<p>
					<b>Time Flies (Limerick)</b> <br />By Madeleine Begun Kane
				</p>
				<p>“Time flies” is a popular phrase. So it does, and in
					frightening ways. Where’s it go? I don’t know. And there’s no way
					to slow It all down. Simply relish the days.</p>

				<p>remember from one of the previous slides "git init --bare"
					has no Working directory, so this is only applicable to your local
					computer.

				<span class="console">git commit -a -m"&lt;message&gt;"</span>
			</p>

			<div class="notes">
				<h3>Status</h3>
				<p>run a "git status" to see the current repository's status.
					You'll see that it shows that there are changes in your working
					directory that need to be staged. You can also run the "git status
					-s" to see the short version, if you don't want to see the
					extraneous messages (because you have seen them thousands of
					times).</p>
				<h3>Adding</h3>
				<p>OK, assuming this is a change that you are going to want, you
					move this file into your index using the "git add". Similarly,
					there is a "git rm" command, should you desire to remove it from
					your index.</p>
				<p>Once you have completed the add, do a "git status" again, and
					you'll notice that the message has changed. There's a section that
					says "Changes to be committed", which indicates the files in your
					Staging area. Now, make another change to "TimeFlies.txt" (that's
					not just whitespace changes). When you do a "git status" now, you
					should see that you now have staged some changes for a commit, but
					there are more in your working directory that have to be added.</p>
				<p>Go ahead and add those changes and check the status
					afterwards.</p>
				<h3>Committing</h3>
				<p>Now that you've made your changes, it's time to commit. Using
					the "git commit" command, this will commit any staged files that
					you changed to your local repository - remember this is local to
					your computer. Since you haven't given this to anyone yet, you
					don't have to worry so much about breaking anyone elses code before
					committing.</p>
				<p>The "git commit -a" command is useful if you are making quick
					changes to files you have already added before (and thus are
					"tracked"). You will find this useful as you start developing
					quickly with Git. This is not a wholesale replacement or wildcard
					for adding, though. Please don't attempt to use it as such.</p>

					<li># of lines added</li>
					<li># of lines removed</li>
					<li>the file permissions of the file combined with the type of
						file</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>How Git Tracks</h3>
				<p>Git does a SHA-1 hash on the file contents, so you can run
					the "touch" command. This will trigger Subversion (at least the
					older versions) to need to commit changes to the file, as this
					updates timestamp.
				<p>In Git, the tracking is oblivious to whitespace and
					timestamps entirely. Running a "git status" shows no differences.</p>

				<p>Now that I've told you how easy it is to make changes in Git,
					you are going to immediately start checking in a bunch of changes
					and find that you've gone in the wrong direction on something and
					need to roll back. It's a fairly common problem.
				<p>Git is designed for easy switching of tasks. It encourages
					you to branch. And since branching is so easy, I encourage you do
					do it for everything. Every little bug or user story that you run
					accross. Make a branch for it. They are easy to make and leave such
					a little footprint that you won't even care that they are around.
				<p>"How do I create a branch?" - You might ask... Easy "git
					branch " + the name of the branch.</p>
				<p>"Then how do I switch to it?" - type the "git checkout " +
					the name of the branch.</p>
				<p>For a list of all known branches (on your computer, not
					remotely), just type in "git branch" with no name following it.</p>
				<p>Open Eclipse - show files. Now looking for the only branch in
					this repository. Switch to it. You'll notice now that when I open
					files, they need to be refreshed. This is because Git changes what
					the Working Directory is pointing to. It now points to the
					reference in the branch and changes layered on top of that.
				<p>Switching to a branch moves all of the files in your Working
					Directory and Staging and lays them over top the new repository
					view. (Show an example of this.) This makes it quite nice, since
					you can decide midway through changes that you need a branch for
					this.</p>

				<p>Run "git checkout master" to switch back to the master branch
					(you can use any branch, but this is common enough), then run the
					command "git merge " + the name of the branch to merge in.
				<p>You don't have to tell the system where to merge from. It
					will determine where the last common shared code was and use that
					as the starting point. At this point it will start automatically
					merging files that don't have line conflicts. If there are line
					conflicts, it will flag them for you to merge manually.</p>
				<p>If you need to merge manually, just use the mergetool
					command. This is also built into most IDEs, and the diff/merge is a
					standard, so you can find any number of tools that will help in
					that regard. Just do a google search for "mergetool" or "difftool"
					and you can find out pretty easily how to set up your favorite to

					do a fetch, followed by the merge in a branch. If there are no
					problems with the merge, it's immediately merged back into the
					branch you are in.</p>
				<p>Now we are ready to push our merged changes back to the
					server. ***Note that if you don't do the fetch+merge/pull first,
					Git will not let you proceed to the push step.*** Run the "git
					push" will send the commits that you have done to the other
					repository, be that in the "blessed repository," or the guys
					computer sitting next to you.</p>

				<p>One of the most useful tools that I have run accross is the
					ability to "stash". Git makes you unable to do a fetch or pull when
					you have changes waiting in your Working or Staging environments.
					This is necessary, because the tools can't let you mix up revision
					history. It needs clean breaks in coding. Sometimes, you can't wait
					for this though. If you do a git stash, it will take all of your
					changes and put them off to the side for later. Then, it will allow
					you to overlay these files on the working directory again at a
					later point. That way, you can stash your files off to the side, do
					your pull, then reapply the stash, getting you the newest changes
					without having to create a branch and merge it manually.</p>
				<p>To apply the stash, you can either apply it directly to the
					branch you are working on or create a new branch, using the "git
					stash branch" command.</p>
				</p>
				<p>You can also name stashes, so that you can have a bunch of
					them at a time, but that's a little more advanced, and if you need
					to do that, I'll let you google it for now. But be aware that the
					option is available.</p>

				<p>One of the reasons that I mentioned that you should update to
					1.8+ is that this is the first time that all of the different
					versions (Windows/Mac/Linux/Unix) have implemented the new
